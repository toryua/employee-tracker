# employee-tracker

NOTES FOR TA or TUTOR (10/30)
1. How can the roles database populate into the "add employees" choices? There must be a better way than what I've done with hard coding.
2. Why can't I get my repeat function to work properly?
3. How do I use the "UPDATE" to add the information from the inquirer prompt
